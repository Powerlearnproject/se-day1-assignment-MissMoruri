Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing and maintenance of sofware. It enebles the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of structured programming modularirties(1960s-1970s)
Object oriented programming(OOP)(1970s-1980s)
Agile software development(1990s-2000s)


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements:Involves gathering user needs and system requirements.
Design:Creating the software's structure, components and user interface
Implementation:Coding and creation of the software according to the design specifications
Testing: Evaluation of system to identify and fix any errors and ensure it meets requirements
Deployment:Releasing the software to customers
Maintenance:Supoorting, updating and improving the software after its deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall focuses on sequential approach with distinct phases flowing down like a waterfal while agile focuses on iterative and incremental approach while focusing on fexibility, collaboration and response to change. 
An example where waterfall would be appropriate is building data centres which is costly or updating an existing system. While with agile it can development of a mobile app


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: Writes codes and implements software solutions
Quality assurance engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing testing plans
Project manager:Designs the overall structure and architecture of software systems.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs: They provide comprehensive tools for writing, debbuging and testing code e.g. visual studio code
VCS: Used for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g. Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenge: Meeting tight deadlines
Solution: Prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit: Testing individual components or modules of software
Integration: Testing interactions between different components
System: Testing the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure that it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is all about crafting your instructions in a way that helps get the best reponses from your AI. It leads to more accurate, informative and relevant results and saves on time and effort



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Tell me about AI
Improved prompt: Explain the concept of AI in simple terms, focusing on its benefits.
